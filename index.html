        <h2>Check-In iOS App</h2>
        <p><br>One of the products our customers can get when they onboard with Flowhub is what we call the “NUG”–essentially an iPhone with a Honeywell scanning case. The NUG acts as the mobile interface for checking-people-in to stores via ID scanning, and for tracking and moving plants in Flowhub’s Grow application. A little backstory: Grow was the first Flowhub product, but was put on hold in the shadow of the more immediately-demanded point of sale application. The Check-In app on a NUG allows budtenders (employees who work at a dispensary, or the cannabis industry’s version of bartenders) to scan customers’ ID’s before they enter the store, so when they walk up to the cashier to purchase whatever product they are looking for, important information like their state-dependent gram-purchasing limit as well as whether they are a medical or recreational customer is automatically at-hand.<br><br>The Check-In iOS app was largely complete by the time I joined the team, but customers were experiencing problems with onboarding new customers in the current UX. When a customer ID is scanned with a NUG, the budtender is prompted to check the customer-in as medical or recreational. The employee is then prompted to fill-out three bits of information: the source of the customer (how they found out about the shop), whether they want to become a member of the dispensary’s loyalty program, and whether they belong in a particular customer group like “Friends”, or “Military”. The initial design of the check-in had a severely restricted card that trimmed upwards of 40px from it’s usable space, and a process of adding a customer that called for seemingly unrelated fields in a scattered way. </p>

      <div class="commentary">
        <p>My redesign worked within the constraints of the original card styling to improve the UX of the check-in flow. Through my early iterations I weighed various button styles and labels, distributions of buttons, card layouts for the customer information, card sizings and transition patterns. </p>

       <p>The final wireframe design consolidated the three categories of fields into three tabs while dramatically increasing the canvas of the card providing room for a larger click space for the fields. I also added notes in my design for the creative director to consult with the iOS engineer, shepherding my design decisions into their discussion. I prototyped the transitions of the card information from the onboarding button state to the input state in FramerJS for the iOS developer to implement, but the Framer file sadly no longer exists at the time of writing this case study. </p>

        <h2>Empty-States</h2>
        <p><br>When I first poked-around the point of sale (POS), it took me a little bit to figure out where I was and what I was doing. All of our customers have an onboarding phase directed by the customer support team, but I was told to familiarize myself with the product on my own. One of the things I thought would help the introductory experience to the POS would be empty-states and “noob-states” for each of the screens, so that became my second project at Flowhub. The only difference for the empty states vs. the Noob states was in the copy, so I’m just going to present 12 iterations of the empty states.<br></p>

      <div class="commentary">
        <p>As I built the empty states, it became increasingly apparent that Helvetica Neue Light in the shades that we were working with wasn’t the most legible for our customers. Given the stage that the company was at, it seemed like I had an opportunity to pivot the brand towards something more distinct and legible. While my initial inspiration for pursuing a different font was these empty states, an <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&ved=0ahUKEwiuk4ugofLQAhUCnBoKHXQSAlcQFghFMAc&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdownload.microsoft.com%2Fdownload%2FB%2F0%2FD%2FB0D4BF87-09CE-4417-8F28-D60703D672ED%2FINCLUSIVE_TOOLKIT_MANUAL_FINAL.pdf&usg=AFQjCNEYhIOK1ThEFIUC8iXVCIybhlHuww&sig2=f409P63S0sY2mLQj59fmZA&bvm=bv.141320020,d.d2s"> accessibility guide I found</a> written by Microsoft Designers persuaded me to advocate for a new font, and a better color-contrast. Thus began my lobbying for a new font for Flowhub.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="commentary">
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p><br>Regardless of the accessibility and brand benefits of getting a new typeface, money is always the first thing a startup considers, so that became one of the main criteria for my typeface argument. Roboto and Open Sans were two great free candidates to start with given the consistency of their design and widespread usage, but in font trials they didn’t fit well with the brand as a whole. Roboto had a good character compression, cranking the efficiency of the screen space we could use, but it was a little too tall to complement the width of the icons. Open Sans leaned-towards the softness I was looking for to fit the brand, but it’s bold weight made the heavier labels really awkward above the lighter text in the rows. These two didn’t fit snugly into the brand as well as I was hoping they would, so I extended my search to fonts outside of the free tier in hope of finding something that was affordable and worthy of a bit of investment. Avenir Next was the perfect example of a font that represented the brand well, but was waaaaayy out of our price range. Having explored fonts that adhered to either the financial criteria or the stylistic criteria, I landed on Gibson by Canada Type. Gibson checked all of the boxes and more when I took it for a trial in the Flowhub UI. In comparison to it’s expensive sans-relative, Gibson actually had more ligatures and more distinct italics than Avenir Next. The bonus as well: Avenir Next is one of the most popular fonts on the market, so Gibson would be a much more unique look for Flowhub’s brand.</p>

        <h2>Detail Views</h2>
        <p><br>On the right side of every point of sale screen there is a column controlled by two tabs. This column displays details about selected items in the center-view, enabling users to do a deep-dive into what happens in the dispensary. The design at the time was a condensed table with the label on the left side and the content on the right. From a pure functionality standpoint, this covered about 80% of the cases of information that it would present, but the other 20% rendered it almost unusable. Sometimes labels would extend far into the right side of the table and have to end in an ellipses (…) before the user new what it was describing, and vice-versa for the content on the opposite side of the table. Given that these detailed views were supposed to denote compliance information, they were definitely due for a UI/UX upgrade. </p>
      </div>
      <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14104075/21959870/58de29c2-da92-11e6-99ce-5503148ab739.png">
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>My design started with maximizing the space given in the column itself. I pushed the label margins up to 12px of the main container, and consolidated the appropriate characteristics into subcategories to use across all of the detail columns for the products and pages. At the top of the column is the subject of interest, denoted with it’s product icon, title, and meta detail such as it’s availability. Below the subject is it’s characteristics and pricing information such as the weight unit, quantity stats, and it’s pricing profile breakdown. Some products have a CBD and THC content, expiration date, and other unique pieces of information, so I adjusted the sections of the column for each product category to fit all that was needed. The next section hosts stats about the product as a whole such as when it arrived, it’s SKU, invoice, and other company-logistic and inventory information. The final section represents the compliance components of the product, where source and store licensing could be found if a dispensary were to be audited. It’s worth mentioning that the ease-of-use of Flowhub as a point of sale system for the cannabis industry greatly reduces the stress of being audited by the federal government at any random time on any given day. This continues to be a major selling point for all of Flowhub’s customers that use the POS application.</p>

      <div class="commentary">
        <p>I used this hierarchy of information with the subject at the top, detail information about the subject in the middle, and compliance at the bottom, as the basis for the rest of the details pages. I’ve included details for the Customer page, Adjustments page, and Drawers page as samples. One of the biggest challenges for the details section was accounting for fields that may or may not appear for every item or subject. The table was a good solution for this due to the fact that it’s just a matter of removing a row or two, but I researched every case of information not being in a certain field and organized the column distribution to accommodate missing fields.</p>

        <h2>Activity Cards</h2>
        <p><br>The other tab on the right side of the screen is reserved for activity descriptions of products and items in the center-view. The activity cards used the same table-view as the details section, with a couple more pixels of margin to present the information in card formats. I combined some of the design from the details columns with upgraded card layouts and comprehensive activity descriptions for the activity section. The descriptions featured employee photos and bolded subjects to make searching through the cards easier. I animated the detail-expansion in Framer, but I didn’t get the chance to complete the full activity card rundown and research for all scenarios of information that could be displayed. My last iteration of the activity card design included micro icons to describe what activity occurred, so that’s where I broke-off and did a deep-dive into designing micro icons. Micro icons took precedence over completing the activity cards because of the introduction of a comprehensive activities page into the POS that would feature a table view of everything that is going on in the dispensary.</p>
      </div>
      <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14104075/21959877/58f90b20-da92-11e6-9f9b-14a2a127303c.png">
      <div class="commentary">
        <h2>Micro Icons and Accessibility</h2>
        <p><br>One of the main reasons we were refreshing the activity card design was to make it very easy for a budtender or manager to scroll through their activity feed and identify what has been going on in their store when they are audited. The icons we were using for products and pages could only fit in areas so small, and they weren’t particularly distinct as you scroll through them quickly. We decided to introduce a new micro-icon system to incorporate into the UI. These icons were to be legible at very small sizes, and were to be paired with bright colored bases to develop a heuristic of familiarity for the budtenders to quickly identify what they are looking for. Along those lines as well, I tried to make the icons and their base colors distinct enough to be identified by someone who was color-blind or someone with poor eyesight. One of the crazy things I learned while working on these icons was how all of the classical rules of maintaining line-width in iconography go right out of the window once you’re working at micro scale. Most of the time you can keep the same line-width, but often times I’d be pushing fractions of a pixel to make sure clearance between two icon segments was wide enough. Selecting base colors for the icons was an interesting task as well, given that there was such a wide variety of activities that could show up in a feed. For the non-heuristic color selections (heuristic like green for add, red for delete) I tried to match colors that had similar hues like green, turquoise, and blue with distinct icons of events that would likely occur in different time intervals, so they wouldn’t appear next to each other very often.</p>

        <h2>Cashier</h2>
        <p><br>The cashier portion of Flowhub’s point of sale application conducts thousands of transactions a day in dispensaries across the U.S. The initial design of the cashier page was exactly the same as the inventory section, with a complete table of items that budtenders pick from and add to a customer’s shopping cart. This design was a quite costly on the loading side, given that not all of our customers have blazing fast internet, and that it would take a while to load-in all of the items before a budtender could actually start using the cashier. This problem was solved by removing the table entirely and installing a simple search box at the top of the screen, but while loading times were significantly reduced, budtenders would have to enter the exact product they were looking for in order to pull-it-up and add it to a customer’s cart. Having to search for the exact product made for a pretty painful UX when a budtender screws up a specific SKU or misses a letter.</p>
      </div>
      <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14104075/21959879/58fad7ca-da92-11e6-8c9c-e3e753a32b1e.png">
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>There’s also the issue of catering to both types of customers that shop at a dispensary: the regular, and the tourist. Regular customers know exactly what they are looking for when they walk through the doors of a dispensary, making the entire purchasing process pretty quick and straightforward. Tourist customers are often people who have little to no experience with cannabis products and have tons of questions regarding their potential cannabis purchase. The simple search box design of the cashier was great for helping the regular customers, but didn’t offer any prompts or up-sell opportunities for when it came to the probing tourist customer. I was tasked with totally revamping the cashier experience to make it easy for a budtender to sell to both groups. <br><br>
        I began by assessing the limitations of the current design and outlining the goals of my redesign. Usability across tablet and desktop, emphasis on up-sell opportunities, transaction speed, and distinctness of products became the main drivers for this redesign, so with those in mind I started developing mockups.

        <p>Having conducted a bit of research into other digital point of sale systems, it was apparent that cards were the preferred design pattern for the main screen, and it’s pretty obvious why: they’re highly visual and offer a generous amount of click or tap space. I tried a couple of methods of presenting the products with various labels and icons, but a budtender needs to know quite a lot more than a regular POS card may show in order to make even a mildly appropriate recommendation. Note how many characteristics a cannabis product can have as points of up-selling to a customer: what type of product it is, how much it costs, what units of weight it is sold by, whether it’s available for medical or recreational sale, what brand it is, what type of blend it is, how much CBD and THC is in it, etc. One of the challenges of this cashier was packing as much of this information into cards while maintaining legibility and clickability. I prototyped touch and hover-states for the cards in HTML and CSS, but the developers expressed concerns about the variety of browsers and devices they’d have to develop this for in a short time period, as well as the usability when it came to touching where information would be displayed on the cards, thereby obstructing the user’s view on touch devices. You can see the evolution of packing information into cards with some of my early trials below: </p>
      </div>
      <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14104075/21959878/58fa1d08-da92-11e6-8a70-7f05b8637e83.png">      
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>I was originally supposed to implement a section for up-selling product specials. My initial designs subdivided the section space into horizontal cards, as most specials were automatically applied to a cart, but weren’t necessarily needed to be selected by a budtender. We decided to remove the specials section from the cashier screen entirely to avoid confusion about what’s actionable and what’s not with this screen. <br><br>The other big challenge with the cashier section was figuring out a simple-enough system for managers to add or remove cards to the main screen. This was important for them to be able to do quickly, so that they could swap out items they want to up-sell at the beginning of every workday or repopulate their cashier landing with new products as others sell-out. Along those lines, managers could chose to fill their cashier screen with the most popular items in a particular layout so budtenders would develop a habit of aiming for a given product in a section of the cashier screen for minimized transaction time. <br><br>There were two main screens in the POS that this system of adding items to cashier cards could be implemented. 1. The cashier, where they would be displayed, and 2. Inventory, where they were stored. It may seem obvious that adding cards from the main cashier screen would be the best solution, but users had already been trained to adjust item characteristics such as availability and type in the inventory section of the app. Adding a “favoriting” option to the items in inventory would change the described characteristics of a product, but there wouldn’t be a good way to organize the order of the favorited products as they were to be displayed on the main cashier page outside of a sortable list in a modal. That sentence doesn’t do enough justice for the argument I had to make to convince the team to put the favoriting feature in the cashier page rather than the inventory page, but just know that it took a lot of convincing. </p>

        <h2>Labels</h2>
        <p><br>Given how new the (legal) cannabis industry is, things are rapidly changing on a day-to-day basis. The U.S. and state governments are working as quickly as they can to foster cannabis into society in the most legal and compliant way possible, but things are happening at such a high velocity that businesses have had to figure out how to adhere to basic guidelines on their own terms. One example is that of compliance labels. Our POS can communicate with label-printing machines to translate digital items in our database to printed tags that store owners can use to keep track of their product. The government defined a base set of guidelines for what these labels must have, but had yet to make a concrete design that all cannabis products must have. While it may be the wild west in the world of cannabis design, I got a chance to make my own interpretations of some of these compliance labels. State governments have a tendency to adopt what has been tried and tested when it comes to cannabis compliance, so hopefully these labels will appear on enough of our customers’ products to be adopted by the industry. At the time of writing this case study, Oregon has since made guidelines specifying font requirements for their labels, but here are some label trials I designed while I was at Flowhub. The idea was to maximize the space that labels could be printed on while incorporating the Flowhub logo as an advertising opportunity.</p>

        <h2>What I Learned at Flowhub</h2>
        <p>
          <br>Compliance is really really tedious. And designing a solution for compliance can get very overwhelming at times. That, coupled with the demands of customers made for a consistently high pace of work. I learned how to <strong>strip-down and condense my design process</strong> into shorter-iteration times to break-up large projects into more manageable components. <br><br>
          With every project I was constantly bouncing ideas off-of Jon, the Creative Director. Given the volume of things he was dealing with, I learned <strong>how to present my work, ideas, and problems quickly and clearly</strong> so he would have everything he needed to provide effective and direct feedback. <br><br>
          Sometimes I would get stuck designing a solution within the patterns and predefined elements of the brand. I learned that <strong>it’s perfectly ok to design a new pattern</strong> as long as the value of the pattern extends beyond a small use case. <br><br>
          Clarity and hierarchy are the best solutions for systems that are inherently large and  confusing. I learned that working inside the box is easier when you push the margins of the box by 10px. <strong>The luxury of space will quickly dissolve if it’s not delegated well.</strong><br><br>
          I designed and redesign systems that would lay the foundation for more features to come, and in doing so I had to vet the design decisions I was making with much more rigor. I learned that <strong>making good design systems early and carefully is the best way to supercharge a longterm workflow. </strong>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><br>The work I’ve shared above is just a selection of some of the projects I had the chance to work on while at Flowhub. As you can tell, I bounced-around to a variety of digital and physical mediums, but was always given the chance to influence the design direction of the company. From the great office migration, to weekly company “Rallies”, to defending a “Design Fort”, to hacky-sack breaks, to Brazilian steakhouse feasts, to absurd emojis in the Slack channel, to arguably working in the strangest industry in the world, my time at Flowhub was everything I could want out of an early-stage startup experience.</p>
